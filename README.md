# Mercury
Made my Samuel Kang @ 7/17/2020 ~ Note-taking app made from C++.
 - File input/output
 - Navigating files/directories on the left margin
 - Link different notes together with different files found online or on the computer
 - Hotkeys for better formatting text, based off Word/Google Docs
Notes to improve the app:
 - Start with minimum amounts of RAM, increase as session goes on
 - Wikipedia-like, hover ability - link it to Wikipedia - hotkey can be CTRL + ALT + W
 -- Definition defining ability when hovering and CTRL - SHIFT - Y
